Each folder contains **small, focused scripts** related to a single AWS service.

---

## ✅ What Belongs Here

- AWS CLI–based scripts (Bash or Python)
- Free-tier–safe automation
- Scripts with clear usage instructions
- Examples that are easy to review and understand

---

## ❌ What Does NOT Belong Here

- Hardcoded AWS credentials
- Production infrastructure setups
- Large, complex frameworks
- Paid-service–heavy workflows
- Copy-pasted scripts without explanation

If it’s risky, expensive, or unclear — it doesn’t belong here.

## 🔐 Security & Cost Notice

These scripts are **examples only**.

- Never include real AWS access keys in code
- Always review AWS pricing before running scripts
- Prefer read-only or reversible actions
- Contributors are responsible for understanding what a script does before execution

Unsafe scripts will be closed immediately.
